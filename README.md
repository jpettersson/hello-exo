# Hello Exo!

A very basic demonstration app that shows how [Exo.js](https://github.com/jpettersson/exo.js) integrates nicely with [Spine.js](http://spinejs.com/) and [TweenLite](http://www.greensock.com/tweenlite/).

## Setup
The example app is a middleman project, so just clone, bundle and run as usual.
