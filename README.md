# Hello Exo!

A very basic demonstration app that shows how [Exo.js](https://github.com/jpettersson/exo.js) integrates nicely with [Spine.js](http://spinejs.com/) and [TweenLite](http://www.greensock.com/tweenlite/).

## Setup

This demo is a middleman project. After cloning this repo, set up and update the submodules to get the Spine and Exo code: 

```
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
```

Then bundle and run middleman as usual.
